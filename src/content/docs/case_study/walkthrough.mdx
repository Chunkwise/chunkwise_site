## Deployment

Chunkwise is deployed using a CLI tool. To get started, clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chunkwise/chunkwise.git
cd chunkwise/cli
poetry install
eval $(poetry env activate)
typer cli.py run deploy
```

Once deployed, you can build and run the client using the following command:

```bash
typer cli.py run client-run [--region=REGION]
```
